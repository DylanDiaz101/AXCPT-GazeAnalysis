# **AX-CPT Eye Tracking Data Processing**

This repository (https://github.com/DylanDiaz101/AXCPT-GazeAnalysis) contains scripts for processing **eye-tracking data** collected during an **AX-CPT (AX Continuous Performance Task)** experiment. The study examines **proactive cognitive control** using **ocular measures** and is based on research conducted by **Jason F. Reimer (PI)**.

## **Overview**
The scripts process eye-tracking data collected using a **Tobii eye-tracker**. The output provides **aggregated trial data** with metrics such as:

- **Visit counts** for specific **Areas of Interest (AOIs)**, including top and bottom probe fixation points.
- **Total Visit Duration (TVD)**, measured in seconds for each AOI during the cue-probe delay.
- **Time to First Fixation**, indicating how quickly participants looked at key AOIs (e.g., bottom-right probe in BX trials).
- **Proportion of trials with first fixations in specific AOIs**, reflecting proactive vs. reactive control strategies.
- **Correct and incorrect trials analysis**, allowing comparisons between performance and gaze behavior.

The data output includes **trial-level** and **aggregated task-level** metrics that help quantify how participants engaged in **proactive cognitive control** based on their eye movement patterns.

The tasks are adapted for **Windows & MacOS** and handle both:
- **Gaze data files** (non-XLSX)
- **Excel-based files** (XLSX)

## **Study Context**
The study titled:
> **"Ocular Measures of Controlled Processing: Examining the Role of Cue Maintenance and Working Memory Capacity in Proactive Cognitive Control"**  
> **PI: Jason F. Reimer, California State University, San Bernardino**  
examines **how eye movement patterns during the cue-probe delay of the AX-CPT** reflect **proactive control engagement**.

## **Data Collection**
- **Tobii Eye Tracker** (60 Hz sampling rate, 0.35Â° resolution, 0.5Â° accuracy)
- **5-Point Calibration** for each participant using **Tobii Studio software**
- **Eye-tracking data extraction** via **Tobii Studio & Python scripts**
- Data includes:
  - **Fixation counts, durations, first fixation latency**
  - **Gaze positions for AOIs (cue, top probe, bottom probe)**

## **Usage**
### **Running the Scripts**
1. Place **input files** into the correct subfolders:
   - **Gaze data files** â†’ `1_ALL_TRIALS_nonxlsx/` or `3_CORRECT_TRIALS_ONLY_nonxlsx/` into `/!INPUT`
   - **Excel-based files (XLSX)** â†’ `2_ALL_TRIALS_xlsx/` or `4_CORRECT_TRIALS_ONLY_xlsx/` into `/!INPUT`
  
2. Run the corresponding script (recommended to run using Python IDLE):
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

3. Processed **output files** will be stored in the `/!OUTPUT/` folder.

### **File Paths in Scripts**
Each script defines:
```python
excel_input_path = "./!INPUT//"  # Location of Excel files
csv_input_path = "./!CONVERTED_INPUT//"  # Temporary folder for converted CSVs
output_path = "./!OUTPUT//"  # Final results location
```
Ensure the correct **input files** are placed before running the script.

## **Dependencies**
To install required Python libraries:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
